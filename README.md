# PayHab - Loan Tracking App for University Students

PayHab is a simple and effective loan tracking app designed specifically for university students who often don’t have cash on hand and need to take small, short-term loans to pay campus vendors. It helps students keep track of how much they owe, to whom, and when it's due—making informal borrowing more organized, transparent, and manageable.
